# I want to write an OS
Don't. Find something else interesting to write. Most operating systems end up being glorified startup screens. The ones which don't *generally* opt for features which are "cool" or exist in real life operating systems rather than those which make life easier for the user.

Instead write an actual program. Something fun, something useful, something completely useless and over-complicated. Whatever. As long as you learn a ton and have fun I don't care - that is what ComputerCraft is about :). But please don't just make an operating system.

If you're struggling for ideas have a look through [Idea Exchange][idex], Or find a useful file format or algorithm which hasn't been implemented in CC yet (DEFLATE compression, PNG and JPEG spring to mind). Do some reading and write a type checker for Lua. Or something which will insert runtime type checks if that is simpler. Maybe write a tic-tac-toe game with an AI (look at algorithms like [Min-max][minmax]). But please don't just make an operating system.

## I *really* want to write an OS
If you insist on making one, make a significantly better shell - see [this][os1] and [this][os2] thread. Take some inspiration from [ClamShell][clamshell] and [MBS][mbs]

## But I want to write a Linux clone!
We've had so many Linux knockoffs I've lost count. Think about the things the Linux kernel does: daemons, process scheduling, drivers, memory managements. All of these are either implemented already in bios.lua or, if they are not, mean people have to write code which depends on your OS' APIs: something which is rarely happens.

My question is why do you want to write an "OS"? There is a whole range of far more exciting and interesting programming challenges out there. Do something which will make me go "wow" rather than "Mark this forum as read".
